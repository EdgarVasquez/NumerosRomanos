## HOW TO USE THE APP
<p>Upon entering the app, it will launch a message saying: "Welcome to the converter of Arabic numbers to Romans", you will have to press a key, and it will ask you for a number, the number you are going to enter must be Arabic or decimal, since otherwise it will not process the request, once the correct number has been entered, it will return the number in roman, each letter inside a parenthesis</p>
<p> Once the number is printed in Roman, it will ask you if you want to convert again, where if you write yes it will ask you for a number again, and if you write something else, the application will be terminated</p>
<p>What was said above will also be executed if you enter an erroneous data</p>
