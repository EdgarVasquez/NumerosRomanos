# What is a Coding Dojo?
<p> It is a place where a group of programmers meet to try to solve a programming challenge, they do it for fun, not for competition or work</p>

# Difference between Requirements, Acceptance Criteria and Test Scenarios.Give examples from a problem other than the reference.
<p> The requirement is basically a property that the software must meet or satisfy, the acceptance criterion is what is going to be evaluated to see if the software really meets that requirement, and finally the scenario is a real and concrete example that was carried out. cape to test the criteria</p>
<p>An example would be: the system allows you to log in, an acceptance criterion is that the password is hidden by another character, and the scenario would be that you entered: "1234" in the password field</p>

# Give two examples of non-functional requirements, and specify their category.
<p> Security: A backup should be created every 12 hours</p>
<p> Usability: the system must have a help line</p>

# What is TDD?
<p> It is a practice in programming that is based on first writing or creating the tests that will be done to the software and then writing the source code of the software.</p>

# What are automated unit tests?
<p> It is based on running the same manual tests, but instead of waiting for someone to run them, they are run over and over again over a period of time</p>

# What was the first unit testing framework and for which language was it created?
<p> JUnit was created with the idea of unit testing Java.</p>

# Describe the components of the xUnit architecture?
<p>  test runner: is an executable that runs the tests implemented using the xUnit framework and reports the result</p>
<p> Test Case: it is the elementary class, a unit test is inherited from here</p>
<p>  Test device: are the conditions or the situation necessary to execute a test</p>
<p> Set of tests: they are the tests that share the same accessory</p>

# List at least three disadvantages of automated unit tests
<p> Creating an automated script requires a high level of technical knowledge</p>
<p>  You could never fully automate the testing of an application</p>
<p>  Sometimes it is more expensive to perform automated tests than manual ones</p>

# List at least three disadvantages of automated unit tests 
<p>  Covers more tests, so it has more depth</p>     
<p>   It is more credible or reliable due to the human factor </p> 
<p>  Speed, unit tests run much faster than manual tests   </p>
